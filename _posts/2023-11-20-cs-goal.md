I do not consider myself as a good engineer nor a good friend.
but, one thought has been tingling somewhere inside my brain since i've been working as a software developer,
not as some glorified engineering researcher who never writes a usable code.

I want to make sure everyone with good heart and will for software development in my team to successfully lead their careers.
